Chrome Extension "PHP.net random functions"
=============================

This Chrome extension opens, in the current tab, a function from PHP.net.

This first release will draw one of the currently 991 functions available.
The functions list is taken from onlinephpfunctions.com and is based on PHP 5.5.5.

I've created and tested it on Chrome version 33.0.1750.117.

I've made a virtue of necessity..

== HOW TO USE ==

- Go to the main extension page and click on the right "Download ZIP" to download the entire package;
- Extract the ZIP into a single folder ( extension-folder-name/all-files );
- Open Google Chrome and write "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar;
- Drag the entire folder and drop it into the Chrome tab just opened;
- The plug in will be automatically installed by Chrome and you will see its icon in the Chrome Extensions list;

That's it!
